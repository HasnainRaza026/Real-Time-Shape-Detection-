# Real Time Shape Detection
This Python openCV Shape Detector program is developed using openCV and Canny edge detector (opencv algorithm) to detect the defined shapes,  and bound them in a bounding box, and display their names.

The Canny edge detector is an edge detection operator that uses a multi-stage algorithm to detect a wide range of edges in images. It was developed by John F. Canny in 1986.

## Getting Statrted
First create **Virtual Enviroment** in the directory, each Virtual Enviroment has their own independent set of Python packages installed in their site directories.

Install the Virtual Enviroment by running this command in your terminal
```py
pip install virtualenv
```

Create the Virtual Enviroment using
```py
 python -m venv VirtualEnvironmentName
```

Finally activate the Virtual Enviroment
```py
VirtualEnvironmentName/Scripts/activate
```

### OpenCV
OpenCV is the huge open-source library for **computer vision**, **machine learning**, and **image processing** and now it plays a major role in real-time operation which is very important in todayâ€™s systems.

OpenCV can be directly downloaded and installed with the use of pip (package manager).
```py
pip install opencv-python
```

To check if OpenCV is correctly installed, just run the following commands to perform a version check:
```py
import cv2
print(cv2.__version__)
```

### NumPy
NumPy is a general-purpose array-processing package. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object and tools for working with these arrays. It is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It is open-source software.

Numpy can be installed for Mac and Linux users via the following pip command:
```py
pip install numpy
```

NumPy is commaonly imported as follow:
```py
import numpy as np
```
